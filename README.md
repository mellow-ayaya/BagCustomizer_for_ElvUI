### About

Do you love the ElvUI bags functionality but would prefer the bags to look more like the default ones, or just be more customizable overall?

This addon is just for you!

Enjoy the default blizz-like theme, the rounded ElvUI theme or the Northrend theme, edit them, or create your own!

Here's what you can expect: a masque-like feature that allows reshaping the inventory slots and adding borders to them, being able to adjust the transparency of the bag window and add textures/background images, move the search bar and buttons, reposition the gold text and more!

You can disable or enable each feature of the addon independently of each other.


### Features

- **Default WoW-like Theme**: Instantly transform your ElvUI bags to match the modern WoW bags look
- **Multiple Preset Themes**: Choose from several ready-to-use visual styles
- **Advanced Customization**: Fine-tune every aspect of your bags:
  - Window backgrounds and textures
  - Custom borders and item slots
  - Gold display and currency frame styling
  - Close button positioning and appearance
  - Search bar and extra buttons
- **Theme Manager**: Save and share your custom themes with others
- **Component Toggling**: Enable/disable features independently
- **Profile Support**: Export settings between ElvUI profiles


### Installation

1.  Download the latest release package (`.zip` file)
2.  Extract the `BagCustomizer_for_ElvUI` folder into your `World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\` directory
3.  Restart World of Warcraft or Reload your UI (`/reload`)
