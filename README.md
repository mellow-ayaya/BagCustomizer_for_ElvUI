# Bag Customizer for ElvUI

Make your ElvUI bags look like the default WoW bags - or create your own awesome custom designs!

## About

2.  Extract the `BagCustomizer_for_ElvUI` folder into your `World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\` directory
3.  Restart World of Warcraft or Reload your UI (`/reload`)
4.  Ensure both ElvUI and Bag Customizer for ElvUI are enabled in the AddOns list

## Getting Started
1. **Try the Default Theme**: It should already be applied to your bags automatically
2. **Explore More Themes**: Type /bcfe in chat and check out the "Themes and Profiles" tab for more pre-made designs

4. **Save Your Creations**: Once you're happy with your settings, save them as a theme

## Good to Know

- Settings are stored in your ElvUI Profile - export them if you want to use across different profiles
- The Bank and Warbank are not currently supported
- Each component can be independently enabled/disabled
