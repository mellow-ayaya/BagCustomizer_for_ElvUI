### About

Do you love the ElvUI bags functionality but would prefer the bags to look more like the default ones, or just be more customizable overall?

This addon is just for you!

Enjoy the default blizz-like theme, the rounded ElvUI theme or the Northrend theme, edit them, or create your own!

Here's what you can expect: a masque-like feature that allows reshaping the inventory slots and adding borders to them, being able to adjust the transparency of the bag window and add textures/background images, move the search bar and buttons, reposition the gold text and more!

You can disable or enable each feature of the addon independently of each other.

### Features

Bag appearance features:

- Window Body: Customize the Inventory background color, Top Texture, UI Texture (none by default) and Art Texture (none by default)
- Layout: Customize the bag Close Button Texture, Close Button Position, Extra Bag Height, Search Bar and buttons settings
- Item Slots: Change the look of the inventory slots and their borders
- Gold & Currencies: Style and position gold display and currency frame
